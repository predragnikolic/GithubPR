## Introduction

LSP for Sublime Text implements the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and it provides features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references etc.

All features are powered by a language server. A language server provides intelligent code completions based on language semantics and an analysis of your source code.

## Installation

* Install [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) from Package Control.

* Add a language server by installing a [LSP-plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/search/LSP-) for your language from Package Control.

<alert type="info">
Read the README for your LSP-plugin to meet the requirements and additional installation instructions.
</alert>

If there is not a LSP-plugin for your language, you can [setup the language server](/setup-language-server) manually.
